This is the unit testing framework for wheels. Currently it only meant for testing out the core
wheels framework. The framework is based directly off RocketUnit (http://rocketunit.riaforge.com)

Packages for each component of the wheels framework is located under the wheels/test directory. 
In each package their contains a tests directory where test should be placed for processing. The 
main package directory can be used to place components and files to be included or called within
the tests. Only components placed in the package's tests directory will be run.

To start the test just call http://<your domain>/wheels/tests/index.cfm

NOTE: you must provide the trailing index.cfm is URL rewriting is turned on.
